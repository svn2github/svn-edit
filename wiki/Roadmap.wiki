#summary A high-level roadmap for the svg-edit project.

This document covers future versions of svg-edit.  For previous versions, see the VersionHistory.

Starting with 2.4, development versions of SVG-edit are given an alphabetic codename that corresponds to the name of a shape.  See potential lists here:

== Proposed Features ==
=== Animation ===

SVG-edit should provide a means of animating SVG content using SMIL so that it can be played back in any browser.  This becomes increasingly important as more browsers come online with SMIL functionality (Webkit and soon Mozilla).
