#summary A high-level roadmap for the SVG-edit project.

= Introduction =

This document covers future versions of SVG-edit. For previous versions, see the VersionHistory, and for the current version, see [https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/ Project home].

Although there is no set date to do so, one important project is to get SVG-edit used on [Wikipedia].

Starting with 2.4, development versions of SVG-edit are given an alphabetic codename that corresponds to the name of a shape.  See potential lists here:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_curves
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regular_polytopes

You can follow all [https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/source/list code commits here] to see any features that have been developed since the latest stable release.

=== Animation ===

SVG-edit should provide a means of animating SVG content using SMIL so that it can be played back in any browser.  This becomes increasingly important as more browsers come online with SMIL functionality (Webkit and soon Mozilla).
