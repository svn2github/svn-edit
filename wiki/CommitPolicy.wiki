#summary Commit access policy

At the moment, the policy is:
  * open bugs on https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/list
  * attach clean patches that fix the problem to the bugs (svn diff from the trunk)
  * after a few successful, non-trivial patches we would consider granting you commit privileges 


Proposed change:
If you want commit access, just ask. We need your Gmail or Google account.
  * If it's a translation: just commit directly. You can even use the web-based interface (awesome!)
  * If you are sure: just commit 
  * If you are pretty sure, but have some doubts:   commit and ask for a review -> https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews
  * If you want some feedback before committing: add a patch to the issue tracker
  * If you want to do something really radical, make an experimental branch


A corollary to a lower threshold to commit access is quick rollbacks, so don't be offended if your commit is rolled back. This is part of the process of learning and collaborating.
