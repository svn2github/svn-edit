#summary Commit access policy

If you want commit access, just ask. We need your Gmail or Google account. Keep in mind that SVG-edit is widely used and changes can have unexpected consequences. Wait for after 2.6 release (and thus trunk re-opening) for any bigger changes. 
  * If it's a translation: just commit directly. You can even use the web-based interface (awesome!)
  * If you are sure: just commit 
  * If you are pretty sure, but have some doubts:   commit and ask for a review -> https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews
  * If you want some feedback before committing: add a patch to the issue tracker
  * If you want to do something really radical, make an experimental branch

A corollary to a lower threshold to commit access is quick rollbacks, so don't be offended if your commit is rolled back. This is part of the process of learning and collaborating.


Until the 2012-12-04 [CommunityConferenceCall], the policy was:
  * open bugs on https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/list
  * attach clean patches that fix the problem to the bugs (svn diff from the trunk)
  * after a few successful, non-trivial patches we would consider granting you commit privileges
