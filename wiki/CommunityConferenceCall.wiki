#summary In November or December 2012, we will hold a community conference call.

=Topics=
== Introduction of participants ==
  * Each person takes a minute or two to introduce themselves
  ** Where do you live?
  ** How do you use SVG-edit?
  ** Where do you want to see the project in the future?


== 2.6 Release ==
  * What is the code status in trunk?
  ** Discuss blockers for a 2.6 release
  ** If we can't release quickly, perhaps just branch so trunk is open again for development?

== Wiki edit rights ==
  * How should we use the wiki?
  ** Used more for community planning discussion?
  ** Explicit way for people to gain edit access


== Commit access policy ==
SVG-edit is awesome. And all the people who worked on it have done a superb contribution to the Free and Open Source ecosystem. The main
contributors according to https://www.ohloh.net/p/svg-edit/contributors?query=&sort=commits are: Alexis, Jeff, Pavol and of course, thank you to Narendra for starting all this.

Now, time goes by, great people get busy with new projects and it's time for renewal within the SVG-edit community. There is a great bit of talent and energy on the mailing lists and the issue tracker. We hope to always count on Alexis, Jeff, Pavol and Narendra when there is a big problem, but we want the community to be sustainable and growing.

The commit activity has slowed in recent years: https://www.ohloh.net/p/svg-edit/commits/summary

Yet, there are patches in SVN. How can we increase the odds that 1- they become appropriate for and 2- they are committed to the main code base?

What should our commit access policy be?

Marc Laporte proposes to think about this: http://info.tiki.org/article188-Tiki-reaches-500-contributors-with-commit-access and to move progressively in this direction. It's a little scary at first but listen to the podcast on that link :-)



== Convergence of energy ==
There are many applications that are based on SVG-edit. Super!  Now, how do we make sure that enhancements are upstreamed?

Let's discuss a way to reduce the number of forks like https://code.google.com/p/cwm-drawtool/ and make projects like http://adityab.github.com/Awwation/ closer and have everyone work in the same code base (with branches, distros, alternate themes, or something!)   Many projects are discussed at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/svg-edit/8uYm9I4KheQ/discussion

  * Why do people fork? 
  ** Let's discuss when this is a "good"/acceptable/best scenario vs when we feel this work should be part of SVG-edit.

== Wikipedia ==
We have:
  * https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SVGEdit
  * https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TranslateSvg
  * https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38271
  * https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1006

Being used for Wikipedia would be the biggest surge of usage for SVG-edit (Wikipedia being a top-10 site in the World)

What are the steps to get there?


== Browser support ==
More or less half the web uses rapid release browsers (Chrome & Firefox). What happens if we want to improve SVG-edit but need something that is not yet available in some of the browsers? (or very difficult to do)

What should our policy be?  


== Consulting ecosystem ==
There are people (ex.: on the mailing list) that are willing to sponsor SVG-edit work. How do we leverage this?
  * List on a wiki page
  * What else?


== Roadmap ==
Let's discuss as a project where we want to be in 3-5 years. What are the features / use cases we would cover if we had tons of contributors the project vs what is outside the scope of the project?

  * SVG-edit is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics_editor. Will it become a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics_editor as well? Ex.: [https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=893|Pixastic Image Processing Library]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=985 SVG-edit can draw on images. Will it one day draw on videos?]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=947 How about realtime collaborative editing?] 
  * There are some non-linear presentation tools like use SVG-edit as a base. Should SVG-edit become a such editor?  [https://github.com/adityab/Awwation#readme Awwation: "The editor is built upon the core of SVG-edit, and uses the Sozi library for zooming animations"]
  * How good will SVG-edit become for [http://www.mind-mapping.org/web-based-mindmappers/graphical.html Concept Maps, Mind Maps, Topic Maps, Flow Charts and Org Charts]?
