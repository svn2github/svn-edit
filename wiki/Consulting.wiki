#summary List of all SVG-edit consultants

__As per the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License MIT license], you do not have to pay anything to anyone to use or integrate SVG-edit. If you code, we hope that you will choose to re-contribute your fixes and enhancements. Additionally, you may __choose__ to pay for support, training, bug fixes and enhancements.

While there is no official endorsement from the point of view of SVG-edit, below is a list of self-identified consultants, who offer services. We ask that all consultants listed here be active within the community and upstream fixes and enhancements, when it's possible/relevant. Some enhancements are just too specific and it may not be acceptable for the official project code base.

I have experience with deep customizations of SVG-Edit. Two projects that I've made with SVGEdit are [http://visualizame.net/editor/index.html Visualizame] and [http://editor.method.ac  Method Draw]. I have experience customizing SVG Edit for mobile too. I only work on projects which are appropriate to upstream to SVG-Edit (relevant as a drawing app and with an MIT License).
