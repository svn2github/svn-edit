#summary A list of browser bugs related to SVG-edit.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

While working on SVG-edit, a number of SVG-related browser bugs were encountered. This page serves to highlight these bugs so they can hopefully be fixed in future versions by the browser makers.

= Bugs =

== Firefox ==

=== Group Opacity has terrible performance ===

*Problem:* When an image has many elements with the opacity attribute set to values less than 1.0, the image (and the editor) cause Firefox to become very slow.

*Version(s):* 3.5-

*Bug Report:* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309782

Other bugs related to Bug 309782:
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=523481
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524089

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Not really.  One option is to avoid using the group_opacity control and change the stroke-opacity and fill-opacity instead.

=== Rotating text element with gradient ===

*Problem:* When a text element has a gradient set and is rotated, the individual glyphs are incorrectly repositioned.

*Version(s):* 3.5/Mac 

*Bug report:* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519472

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* No, does not appear possible.

== Opera ==

=== Cloning elements with float values in attributes ===

*Problem:* When an element is cloned using .cloneNode(), any attributes of the clone with a float value has its value changed to use a comma rather than a period (i.e. 5.5 becomes 5,5). The result is that the element has invalid attribute values and fails to render properly or at all.

*Version(s):* 10/Win XP/Non-English locales

*Bug report:* Unknown

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Yes

=== Moving cloned groups makes them smaller ===

*Problem:* issue 229

 
*Version(s):* 10/Win XP/Non-English locales

*Bug report:* DSK-266662@bugs.opera.com

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Not yet

== Webkit ==

=== Path Segments and Points Normalized ===

*Problem:* Webkit internally normalizes path segments and point lists and does not provide the original string.

*Version(s):* All, Safari & Chrome

*Bug reports:* 
 * https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26487
 * https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29870

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Handle all path segment types and check if commas are present in the point list.

=== Path Segments Cannot be Added/Removed ===

*Problem:* Manipulating segments using insertItemBefore, removeItem, etc fail to actually affect the path element.

*Version(s):* All, Safari & Chrome

*Bug reports:* 
 * https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30219

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* None yet (may have to resort to directly editing the "d" attribute)

=== Matrix Multiplication Incorrect ===

*Problem:* WebKit does not multiply two SVGMatrix objects together properly.

*Bug reports:*
 * https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16062

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Do the matrix multiplication ourselves.

=== @transform value is unreliable ===

*Problem:* WebKit changes the value of the @transform attribute just by accessing an element's SVGTransformList.

*Bug reports:*
 * https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31119

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Implement our own "shim" version of SVGTransformList
