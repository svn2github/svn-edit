= Introduction =

While working on SVG-edit, a number of SVG-related browser bugs were encountered. This page serves to highlight these bugs so they can hopefully be fixed in future versions by the browser makers.

= Bugs =

== Firefox ==

=== Rotating text element with gradient ===

*Problem:* When a text element has a gradient set and is rotated, the individual glyphs are incorrectly repositioned.

*Version(s):* 3.5/Mac 

*Bug report:* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519472

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* No, does not appear possible.

== Opera ==

=== Cloning elements with float values in attributes ===

*Problem:* When an element is cloned using .cloneNode(), any attributes of the clone with a float value has its value changed to use a comma rather than a period (i.e. 5.5 becomes 5,5). The result is that the element has invalid attribute values and fails to render properly or at all.

*Version(s):* 10/Win XP/Non-English locales

*Bug report:* Unknown

*Workaround in SVG-edit:* Yes

=== Moving cloned groups makes them smaller ===

*Problem:* issue 229

=== Path Segments and Points Normalized ===
