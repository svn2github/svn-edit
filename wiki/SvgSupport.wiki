#summary A summary of the elements and attributes that SVG-edit supports.

== SVG Element and Attribute Whitelist ==

I apologize up-front for the poor format of this table, I blame the wiki markup allowed in Google Code.

Anything not listed here is not supported by SVG-edit and will be stripped out upon import.  SVG-edit supports the following elements and attributes:

|| *Element* || *Attributes* ||
|| *All Elements* || id, requiredFeatures, systemLanguage ||
|| *All Shapes* || fill, fill-opacity, fill-rule, stroke, stroke-dasharray, stroke-dashoffset, stroke-linecap, stroke-linejoin, stroke-miterlimit, stroke-opacity, stroke-width, transform ||
|| circle || cx, cy, r ||
|| defs ||  ||
|| desc ||  ||
|| ellipse || cx, cy, rx, ry ||
|| g ||  ||
|| image || xlink:href, xlink:title ||
|| line || x1, x2, y1, y2 ||
|| linearGradient || gradientTransform, gradientUnits, spreadMethod, x1, x2, y1, y2 ||
|| path || d ||
|| polygon || points ||
|| polyline || points ||
|| radialGradient || cx, cy, fx, fy, gradientTransform, gradientUnits, r, spreadMethod ||
|| stop || offset, stop-color, stop-opacity ||
|| svg || height, viewBox, width, xmlns, xmlns:xlink ||
|| switch ||  ||
|| rect || height, rx, ry, width, x, y ||
|| text || font-size, font-family, font-style, font-weight, text-anchor, x, xml:space, y ||
|| title ||  ||

== Non-Editable Items ==

At this time, the following attributes cannot be edited in the user interface of SVG-edit (but they can be tweaked using the SVG source editor within SVG-edit):

  * fill-rule
  * stroke-dashoffset
  * stroke-linecap
  * stroke-linejoin
  * stroke-miterlimit

In addition, there is no way within jGraduate (the color picker used in SVG-edit) to:

  * create a radial gradient
  * add stops to any gradient (limited to two stops only)
