#summary FAQ for svg-edit

*Q: Why doesn't svg-edit work in Internet Explorer?*

A: SVG-edit only works in IE6+ if you have installed the [http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/ Google Chrome Frame plugin].  At this time, Internet Explorer does not natively support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).  There are several other possibilities:
  * someone gets it to work with the [http://svgweb.googlecode.com/ SVG Web] shim
  * someone gets it to work with IE and the Adobe SVG Viewer
  * someone gets it to work with another SVG plugin
  * a future version of IE natively supports SVG

*Q: How can I set the stroke to 'none'?

A: Shift-clicking palette squares sets the Stroke paint value.  Thus, you can shift-click on the None box (red x on white background) to clear the Stroke paint.

*Q: How can I select an element when it's hidden or behind another one?

A: Select an object. Shift+O will select the previous object Shift+P will select the next object

*Q: Can I trace over a raster (PNG, JPEG...) image?

A: SVG-edit 2.4 features support for raster image elements and layers, so this is quite achievable using those two features.  Though SVG-edit 2.4 has not been released yet.

If you are still using SVG-edit 2.3-, you can embed raster images You can if you have downloaded SVG-edit and run it from your computer. This will add an image as a background for the canvas, you'll get something like this:

http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/svg-edit-background-image_thumb.jpg

- Open the file svg-editor.css - Find the lines:

#svg_editor #svgcanvas {
  background-color: #FFFFFF;

- Just below these lines, add:

  background-image: url(file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/XP/Mes%20documents/stuff/SVGeDrawings/my_own_image.jpg);

or you can add the URL to an online image:

  background-image: url(http://www.anything.com/...)

Be careful that the file:///url must have the properly encoded format.

You can specify more options, like:

    background-repeat: no-repeat / repeat-x... etc. background-position: center center / top left / 20% 80%... 

See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-background-image for details.

- Save svg-editor.css and now open svg-editor.html with your browser.

* Q: How come I'm not seeing the latest SVG-edit version when I access the [http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html online trunk version] in Firefox 3.5+ ?

A: Between September 25, 2009 ( r715 ) and October 8, 2009 ( r783 ), we had experimented with the Offline resources features of HTML5, to allow SVG-edit to run offline. There was a cache manifest which asked for storing local files. 

This was causing problems with Firefox 3.5+, so it was removed. Anyway, if you have visited the above URL and have items stored locally during this period, you might experience that the version you see still uses the outdated cache files.

The solution is to delete the offline cache items - preferably with a Sqlite manager addon for Firefox, for instance [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817 SQLite Manager].
