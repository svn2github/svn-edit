#summary FAQ for svg-edit

*Q: Why doesn't svg-edit work in Internet Explorer?*

A: At this time, Internet Explorer does not natively support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).  There are several possibilities:
  * someone gets it to work with IE and the Adobe SVG Viewer
  * someone gets it to work with the svgweb shim
  * someone gets it to work with another SVG plugin
  * a future version of IE natively supports SVG
