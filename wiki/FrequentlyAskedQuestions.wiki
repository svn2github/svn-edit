#summary FAQ for svg-edit

*Q: Why doesn't svg-edit work in Internet Explorer?*

A: At this time, Internet Explorer does not natively support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).  There are several possibilities:
  * someone gets it to work with IE and the Adobe SVG Viewer
  * someone gets it to work with the svgweb shim
  * someone gets it to work with another SVG plugin
  * a future version of IE natively supports SVG

*Q: How can I set the stroke to 'none'?

A: Shift-clicking palette squares sets the Stroke paint value.  Thus, you can shift-click on the None box (red x on white background) to clear the Stroke paint.
