=Topics=
== Introduction of participants ==
  * Each person takes a minute or two to introduce themselves. This also serves to make sure sound is OK for all. Please have a headset.

   * How do you use SVG-edit? (if this takes more than 30 seconds, please add as a presentation below)
   * What is on your mind for this meeting (which topic of the agenda interests you the most)?

  * Each project presents in 2-5 minutes an overview of how they use SVG-edit. Presenters: you'll be able to [http://www.bigbluebutton.org/overview/ share URLs in the chatroom, or you can upload PDFs to the presentation tool]

This is for projects that didn't present in the previous call or that have something new to share.


== Wikipedia ==

Being used for Wikipedia will be the biggest surge of usage for SVG-edit (Wikipedia being a top-10 site in the World)

What are the next steps to get there?


== Release cycle ==
Let's start the discussion. And we should eventually come up with some realistic and commonly understood guidelines. 
Some examples:
  * A release every 6 months like Ubuntu (October and April)
  * Release at any time (when energy and features are there), but never more than 12 month between releases.

== Convergence of energy / Roadmap / Revamp ==
Please present your ideas and proposals. Ideally, in writing before the meeting so people can read and be ready with questions.


== 2.7 Release ==
  * What is the code status in trunk?
   * [https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/list?can=2&q=NeededFor%3D2.7 The current list of issues tagged needed for 2.7]
    * Let's discuss "real" blockers for a 2.7 release, because the list above is quite long!
