#summary Information on setting configuration options

= Introduction =

As of version 2.5 (currently still in alpha stage), SVG-Edit has several configuration settings that can be overridden either by adding URL parameters or by setting the options in JavaScript.

== How to set the options ==

Options can be set using svgEditor.setConfig(options), where "options" is an object literal of keys and values. This must be run _before_ the actual page or DOM is loaded, else it will have no effect.

Example:

{{{
svgEditor.setConfig({
	dimensions: [320, 240],
	canvas_expansion: 5,
	initFill: {
		color: '0000FF'
	}
});
}}}

This will set the default width/height of the image, the size of the outside canvas, and the default "fill" color.

The same options can be set in the URL like this:

{{{
.../svg-editor.html?dimensions=300,240&canvas_expansion=5&initFill[color]=0000FF
}}}

If options are set both using .setConfig() as well as in the URL, the URL value will be used.
