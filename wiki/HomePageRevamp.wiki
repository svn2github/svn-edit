= Demos =

Try out <b>[http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.5.1/editor/svg-editor.html SVG-edit 2.5.1]</b>, the latest stable release ([VersionHistory Release notes]).

For the adventurous ones, feel free to try out the [http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html trunk build] (not guaranteed to be stable).
